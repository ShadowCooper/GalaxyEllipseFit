# Galaxy Ellipse Fit
## About
A script that allows you to fit ellipses to a galaxy and its polar structure. Sometimes.

## Usage
python ellipseFitting.py myFolderWithFitsFiles myDesiredOutputFolder

It'll automatically re-create any subdirectories that were in the input folder in the output folder

## Output
.json file with ellipse fit results, .jpg showing the fits and contours, (both of those are if the fitting was "successful") error log file for failed galaxies
